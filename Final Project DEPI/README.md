**Cisco CyberSecurity Final Project: Comprehensive Network Infrastructure Setup**

This project involves the design and implementation of a **comprehensive network infrastructure** for an organization. The goal is to develop a network that is **scalable**, **secure**, and **efficient**, ensuring optimal performance and robust protection against potential threats. By integrating advanced technologies and security protocols, the infrastructure is tailored to meet the needs of a modern organization.

### **Project Objectives**
- Establish a scalable and secure network to support organizational operations.
- Ensure high availability and minimal downtime.
- Implement robust security measures to protect the network from potential attacks.
- Optimize performance and provide flexibility for future expansions.

### **Key Components of the Project**

#### **1. VLANs for Network Segmentation**
   - Virtual LANs (VLANs) are implemented to segment the network logically, enhancing security and improving traffic management.

#### **2. High Availability with HSRP**
   - Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) ensures network availability by providing a redundant gateway in case of failure.

#### **3. Dynamic Routing with OSPF**
   - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is used for efficient and dynamic routing, ensuring reliable communication across the network.

#### **4. DHCP**
   - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates the assignment of IP addresses to devices, simplifying network management.

#### **5. IP Telephony with QoS**
   - IP telephony is implemented with Quality of Service (QoS) to prioritize voice traffic and ensure high-quality communication.

#### **6. Wireless LAN with Security**
   - A secure wireless network is configured using **WPA2/WPA3 encryption** to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### **7. Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
   - ACLs are used to regulate traffic flow and restrict unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

#### **8. Port Address Translation (PAT)**
   - PAT is configured to enable multiple devices to share a single public IP address, optimizing internet access.

#### **9. SSH for Remote Access**
   - Secure Shell (SSH) is used for encrypted remote access to network devices, ensuring secure management.

### **LAN Security Measures**
To strengthen network security, the following measures are implemented:

- **Port Security:** Prevents unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
- **BPDU Guard:** Protects the spanning tree topology by blocking rogue BPDU packets.
- **Root Guard:** Prevents unauthorized devices from becoming the root bridge in the spanning tree.
- **DHCP Snooping:** Blocks malicious DHCP servers and ensures only authorized servers can allocate IPs.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI):** Prevents ARP spoofing and poisoning attacks.
- **Storm Control:** Limits broadcast, multicast, and unicast traffic to prevent network flooding.
- **VLAN Hopping Prevention:** Protects against attacks that exploit VLAN tagging.

### **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a robust, secure, and scalable network infrastructure. By leveraging advanced technologies and best practices, the network is equipped to handle the demands of a modern organization while maintaining a high level of security and efficiency.
